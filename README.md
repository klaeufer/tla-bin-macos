# tla-bin-macos

tla-bin is a wrapper around https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus that provides
command line binaries for pcal, tlc, tlatex and sany, making automation around
TLA+ easy.  Also provides a binary that starts the TLA+ REPL.

tla-bin-macos is a fork of tla-bin that assumes that the TLA+ Toolbox is already installed in /Applications.

## Installation

### Install the binaries in /opt/tla/bin

```
$ git clone https://github.com/klaeufer/tla-bin-macos.git
$ cd tla-bin-macos
$ sudo mkdir /opt/tla
$ sudo cp -a bin /opt/tla
```

### Add /opt/tla/bin to PATH

For the current shell session:

PATH=/opt/tla/bin:$PATH

To add `/opt/tla/bin` to your path permanently, use the appropriate steps for your shell.

## Usage

Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 2.7E-19
6 states generated, 5 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 5.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 1 and the 95th percentile is 1).
